Privacy Policy<br/>
Our privacy policy, which sets out how we will use your information, can be found at [Privacy Policy Link]. By using this Website, you consent to the processing described therein and warrant that all data provided by you is accurate.
<br/><br/>
Prohibitions<br/>
You must not misuse this Website. You will not: commit or encourage a criminal offense; transmit or distribute a virus, trojan, worm, logic bomb or any other material which is malicious, technologically harmful, in breach of confidence or in any way offensive or obscene; hack into any aspect of the Service; corrupt data; cause annoyance to other users; infringe upon the rights of any other person's proprietary rights; send any unsolicited advertising or promotional material, commonly referred to as "spam"; or attempt to affect the performance or functionality of any computer facilities of or accessed through this Website. Breaching this provision would constitute a criminal offense and MaskTalisman will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and disclose your identity to them.
<br/><br/>
We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack, viruses or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of this Website or to your downloading of any material posted on it, or on any website linked to it.
<br/><br/>
Terms of Engagement<br/>
To enter into a contract with MaskTalisman, you must be at least 18 years old and possess a cryptocurrency wallet that we accept. MaskTalisman has the right to reject any request you make.
<br/><br/>
When each MaskTalisman NFT is sold for the first time, MaskTalisman and the original purchaser enter into a sales agreement. MaskTalisman is not a party to any agreement between the buyer and seller of MaskTalisman NFTs, or between any other users, if the first purchaser decides to sell the MaskTalisman NFT through this Site. This Site serves simply as a platform to enable transactions between a buyer and a seller.
<br/><br/>
All MaskTalisman NFTs are kept on the Ethereum blockchain and are accessible through it. Therefore, MaskTalisman does not maintain the MaskTalisman NFTs on this website, and other than giving control of the MaskTalisman NFT to the first purchaser, MaskTalisman has no influence over the transfer, storage, ownership, or maintenance of the MaskTalisman NFT.
<br/><br/>
When you link your cryptocurrency wallet to the Site through a reputable service provider such as MetaMask, you acknowledge and agree to be governed by these Terms and all terms incorporated by reference.
<br/><br/>
When placing an order, you warrant that all information provided is accurate and that you are an authorized user of the cryptocurrency wallet. All listed prices are subject to change.
<br/><br/>
You acknowledge that by placing an order on the Site, you are submitting a legally binding offer to acquire an MaskTalisman NFT or other Service. If you are the first purchaser of an MaskTalisman NFT or if you are acquiring a Service, you must pay MaskTalisman any outstanding charges. If you are not the first purchaser of an MaskTalisman NFT, monies may be paid to the subsequent holder. You also understand and agree that MaskTalisman earns 7,5% of each future sale of an MaskTalisman NFT (the "Royalty"). MaskTalisman has the right to collect Royalties on MaskTalisman NFT sales in perpetuity and may utilize these monies as it sees fit.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, if you sell an MaskTalisman NFT on a third-party NFT marketplace, you agree to add a statement substantially similar to the one below in the NFT's description: "7,5% ROYALTY APPLIES. SEE THE MaskTalisman TERMS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION."
<br/><br/>
Additionally, when you purchase or sell an MaskTalisman NFT on this website, you agree to pay all relevant transaction costs and enable MaskTalisman to automatically charge and collect such fees from your payment. Prior to your purchase or sale of an MaskTalisman NFT, we will always show a breakdown of all transaction and associated expenses.
<br/><br/>
All sales are final. We do not provide returns, refunds, or exchanges for NFTs at this time.
<br/><br/>
Linking Your Cryptocurrency Wallet<br/>
When you link your cryptocurrency wallet, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and your control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible tokens, or cryptocurrencies stored in or accessible through your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency wallet by third parties might lead to the loss or theft of MaskTalisman NFTs and/or cash contained in your wallet and any related wallets, as well as any linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit card information (s). We are not responsible for the management and maintenance of your cryptocurrency wallet's security, nor for any unauthorized access to or use of your cryptocurrency wallet. Please tell us immediately if you observe any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your cryptocurrency wallet that appears to be connected to our website.
<br/><br/>
Raffles, Contests and Giveaways<br/>
Additionally, we do prizes on Twitter and Discord. We also offer raffle tickets using cryptocurrencies. We either utilize a live wheel or a Discord bot to determine winners. Please be careful to read and comprehend the event-specific regulations in our Discord server.
<br/><br/>
We are not responsible for giveaway, date, or prize offering errors. We have the right to discontinue a promotion for any reason and/or alter the prizes in certain circumstances. We are not responsible for event cancellations or postponements.
<br/><br/>
In addition, occasionally other parties contribute rewards, and we cannot be held responsible if they fail to deliver.
<br/><br/>
Taxes<br/>
We are not responsible for assessing the withholding, sales, use, value added, transfer, or other taxes that may apply to transactions on this website (collectively, "Taxes"), together with any applicable interest and penalties. You acknowledge that you are entirely responsible for deciding which Taxes, if any, apply to your transactions and for withholding, collecting, reporting, and remitting the relevant Taxes to the respective taxing authorities. Unless otherwise specified on an applicable invoice, all monies due on this website are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes (collectively, "Sales Taxes"). This implies that you are solely responsible for Sales Taxes. You agree to furnish, upon our request, a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or relevant Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 and any other tax form that is reasonably required by us to comply with our tax reporting responsibilities.
<br/><br/>
Risks<br/>
Please be aware of the following risks associated with accessing, purchasing, selling, and using MaskTalisman NFTs: The pricing and liquidity of blockchain assets, such as MaskTalisman NFTs, are highly volatile and susceptible to substantial swings. MaskTalisman NFTs might be considerably and negatively impacted by fluctuations in the prices of other digital assets, which are likewise susceptible to severe price volatility. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may have a negative impact on the use, transfer, exchange, and value of MaskTalisman non-fiat currencies. MaskTalisman NFTs are not legal currency and have no government backing. Transactions involving MaskTalisman NFTs may be irreversible, so losses resulting from fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Certain transactions involving MaskTalisman NFTs shall be deemed to have occurred when they are recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time you initiated the transaction. The worth of MaskTalisman NFTs may be determined from the continuous desire of market players to exchange fiat money or digital assets for MaskTalisman NFTs, which may result in the permanent and entire loss of value of a specific MaskTalisman NFT if its market disappears.
<br/><br/>
You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks, and that we do not provide advice or recommendations regarding MaskTalisman NFTs, including the suitability and appropriateness of MaskTalisman NFTs and investment strategies for MaskTalisman NFTs. You acknowledge and accept that you access and use this website at your own risk; nonetheless, this brief statement does not reveal all of the hazards connected with MaskTalisman NFTs and other digital assets. You agree and acknowledge that we are not liable for any communication failures, interruptions, mistakes, distortions, or delays you encounter when using MaskTalisman NFTs, regardless of the source.

Disputes and Arbitration Agreement<br/>
Please read the following arbitration agreement carefully ("Arbitration Agreement"). It obligates you to arbitrate conflicts with MaskTalisman and restricts your ability to seek remedies from us.
<br/><br/>
Compliance with Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access to or use of the Site, to any Services sold or distributed through the Site, including MaskTalisman NFTs, or to your relationship with MaskTalisman shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or MaskTalisman may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
<br/><br/>
Arbitration Rules and Forum.<br/>
This Arbitration Agreement's interpretation and enforcement are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. To initiate an arbitration case, you must write a letter to our registered agent including a demand for arbitration and a description of your claim: MaskTalisman@gmail.com JAMS, a reputable alternative dispute resolution company, will administer the arbitration. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, excluding lawyers' fees and interest, shall be governed by the most recent version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures accessible at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other claims shall be governed by the most recent version of JAMS' Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which may be found at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. The JAMS regulations can also be accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 800-355-5267. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate, the parties will choose an alternate forum. If the arbitrator determines that you cannot afford to pay JAMS' filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees, and you are unable to get a waiver from JAMS, MaskTalisman will pay those expenses on your behalf. You may opt to have the arbitration performed through telephone or video conference. You consent to the entry of any judgment on the arbitrator's award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br/><br/>
Arbitrator's competence<br/>
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is null and void. Arbitration will determine your and MaskTalisman's rights and responsibilities, if any. The arbitration procedure will not be combined or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and any non-monetary remedy or relief available to a party under applicable law, the rules of the arbitration forum, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall produce a written award and judgment explaining the fundamental facts and conclusions upon which the award is based, as well as the computation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same ability to provide individual relief that a judge would have in a court of law. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on both parties. In the event any monetary or non-monetary remedy or relief is awarded, you agree that such relief may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br/><br/>
Waiver of Jury Trial.<br/>
You and MaskTalisman forego all constitutional and statutory rights to file a lawsuit in court and have a trial before a judge or jury. You and MaskTalisman alternatively decide to have any claims and disputes handled by arbitration in accordance with this arbitration agreement, unless otherwise specified in this section. Individually, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court and must follow the terms of this arbitration agreement as a court would. In arbitration, there is neither a judge nor a jury, and judicial review of an arbitration ruling is restricted.
<br/><br/>
Renunciation of collective or other non-individual relief.<br/>
All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated individually, not collectively or as a class, only individual remedy is possible, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or merged with those of another customer or user. All other claims are subject to arbitration.
<br/><br/>

If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, the remaining terms of this Agreement will still apply. The decision to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement has no bearing on any other arbitration agreements that you may now have with us or join in the future.
<br/><br/>
Waiver<br/>
If you breach these conditions and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these conditions.
<br/><br/>
